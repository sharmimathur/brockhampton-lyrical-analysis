Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk
Losing my way, ohh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(No worries) Losing my way, ohh
Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry
But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to settle
To do what I am
To say what I am
Don't waste your mind
I'll be the one to settle
To do what I am
To say what I am

Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again
Runnin' outta time again, mmm
Ay-yeahh, ay-yeahh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh, ooh
In the heat of the summer, oh
Yeah, yeah, mhm
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you know
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know, oh-oh
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you do
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know
You know that you should be my boy
Oooh, yeah, yeah
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know, oh-oh
You know that you should be my boy
Oh, yes, you know, oh yes, you know
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know

Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

Evanie, did you lie to him since you were seventeen?
How's he holding up?
Evanie, do you cling to him like you would onto me?
Bet he needs you more than I
Evanie, did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels
Evanie, every chance you take you make me want to flee
Can't you see?


You should move on
I swear you'll be fine
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And when you're alone, and his love is gone
Maybe you'll see that your company was the worst
Thing for him, your sin


Ooh, yeah
Soon, soon
No, no, no, no, no, no
