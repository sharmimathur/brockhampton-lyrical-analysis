"—perfectly fine, that's fine!"

said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
is you gon' finish what you started? what you quitting for?
they told me god gave me a mission
but i'm missing the supplies to complete it
i ain't the one you should read in, i'm used to being defeated
so nigga, brother who you standing with?
i'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
the feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
i'm so accustomed to flames, i couldn't tell you what's fire
situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
the disposition acquired from my position on earth
it's telling me "decapitate everything for what it's worth!"
when i die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
i don't rhyme, i freeze time and let these hands just do the work
i'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
see the canvas as a planet i'm commanding with my nerves, ah

tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions
tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy, i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions

try to treat man like baby
feel the teeth sink in like rabies
ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
boy, you know you don't look fly
them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
who you keep around now? that's a big reflection
don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
kill the ego now, what that make of me?
angle widescreen, couple sips of tanqueray
i'ma throw a couple punches, i'ma do it anyway
chin up little son, i slide in like the macarena
lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
got this martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
i'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

impending death is the only sign of life
i'm throwing hail marys 'til i die
throw it up, all i have is peace of mind, throwin' up
have my wings clipped, i don't need them shits
learn to fly again
fast track to last place, i swear
i've never been up top but i'm up here somewhere
out here, nobody can tell me shit
shit, never mind what i did back then
you should take a look at yourself instead
maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy, i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions
tell 'em boys, don't run from us
i been down too long, cousin
i been down too long, brother
tell the world, i ain't scared of nothing
tell the world, i ain't scared of jumping
tell my boy, i want a crib in london
tell the world to stop tripping, i'll
build a different house with some different functions

hoo! voodoo man
momma took me to the church and i sang a hymn
co-colonized chris-ti-an
now i'm losing my reli-gi-on
god damn, so narcissistic this millennium
fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
i don't go to church, but i'm so spiritual
pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
if jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
all these diamonds in my face, i'm shining like the day
i'm living in my prime, man, what can i say?
if the service is an hour, i'm an hour late

i gotta get that bag
it's a thug life, it's a thug life
i gotta get that bag (run, sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
it's a thug life (la-da-da-da)
it's a thug life (it's a, oh-uh-oh)
ooh-ah (sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
la-da-da-da (it's a— ooh-uh-oh)

try to treat man like baby
feel the teeth sink in like rabies
boy you know you don't look fly
dem gold chains turn your neck green, bye


it's different reconciling with skeletons i ain't know i possessed
i sought perfection out in ways i no longer accept
i understand what i neglect in times when i obsess
i'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
the biggest threat i'm up against is who i face in my reflection
depression still an uninvited guest i'm always accepting
can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
when i know that it'll kill me if i give into my brain
i see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
they put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
the sun reflecting off the corals, colors i can't describe
to make the darkness divine

she said, "baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
i'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
if i got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
we got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
now look, look
trade in thatoose they put around us for a cuban link
so my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
i remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
that pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
what you choosing?
no chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (hoo!)
we live life like cheetah power up like hummer diesel
golden chain for niece and nephew
pessimistic, i do not hang 'round them boys
metaphysics, need another dimension i can enjoy
she said, "baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
i'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
if i got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
we got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
now look, look
baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
i'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
if i got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
we got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
now look, look
reporting for the operation
i learned that the beauty is in the creation
i added my detail for decoration
so baby boy, what's the occasion?
you dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
avoiding social litigation
when that admiration turns into abrasion
y'all can find another station
otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
rolling deeper than a dune
howling at the moon, i'll be back in june
told my baby i'd be back in november
did some beatles shit to kick off this september
crazy 'cause in 2010, i had some old friends
that thought i'd be another—[censored]
go fucking figure
if i pull up out the tool, riding still up on the roof
seems like only legends do
(check this, hot lookin' babes!)
bitch, and that's the fucking move
(i feel you, when she said—)
she said, "baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?"
i make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
if i got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
we got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
now look, look
baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
i make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
if i got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
we got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
now look, lookgood riddance, goodbye, out of sight, out of mind
cutthroat every time, this time i get what's mine
where the hell is your back bone?
ducking me like whac-a-mole
looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
lick my finger, bet i found the wind
i follow that shit wherever it blows
you hung yourself, that's not my fault
i just supplied the rope, ugh!
most thoughts, i don't think twice, make decisions i'll die by
never asked for the drama, but i'll turn it into dollars
dollars, dollars, dollars"do you think about me?"
ohh, ohh

they split my world into pieces, i ain't heard from my nieces
i been feeling defeated, like i'm the worst in the boyband
i ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', i keep the world in my hands
i know accounts should be deleted
i know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
whenever they needing money or favors done
'cause i'm still worried 'bout when ashlan finna put the razor down
so i don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
and i ain't done (no, no)
yeah (tell something)
and i ain't done, you heard me?
i ain't done (yeah, i'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
i really miss the old days before the cosigns
i really miss them cold days before the road signs
i really miss when i ain't know which way i was supposed to head
and i was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
i was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
and she was mad 'cause i never wanna show her off (scared)
and every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
i thought i had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screami don't wanna waste no more time
i'm ready to go
i put my life on standby
i can leave you alon'cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
life is a dish served cold most times
and all my life i've taken handfuls
force-fed by the hand that feeds us
but not all hands created equal
i stand by, waiting for something good to come
in due time, the skies will split for the sun to smilmy mother called me today
she said she thought she felt my energy a country away
i apologized for not calling enough due to weight
but couldn't tell you if i kept it in my head to decay
i asked her "why this world love echoing hate?"
she said "don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
i think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
it's no debate
the road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
and recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
this world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
and analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
if people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
you never needed them if they make you another villaipressure
"they tried to take the bike. and they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. and then, um, then some (pressure) random stranger brought back his bike. we just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble (pressure makes me—) because they found out like a day later."

"yeah, you know, that's what i was explaining to somebody. i said i didn't mind gettin' jerked because i was like, i just want my record on the radio, i just wanna shoot videos"
"...and get it popping"
"i just wanna get popping. look, i don't care—take my publishing, i don't know what that is anyway, you know what i'm saying? like just take my shit so i can have a video and songs on the radio, i'll figure it out later"
"that's crazy, man"

nigga, nigga, nigga, nimy people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
that's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
when our women start to die, when our children start to die
i don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
every summer in the city start to feel like columbine
'cause you gotta get yours, and i gotta get mine
one time for the paragons of the paradigm
when you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
you couldn't match my alien, i'm glowing like uranone time for the— one time—
one time— nigga, one time— nigga
one time— nigga, one t—

"yo, get—[censored]—turn that shit over, bo¿cómo se dice? don't touch on me with them dedos
i minimize all your credentials, i maximize all of my pesos
i want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
i'm one-handed like odell, numb the pain like orajel
up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like "oh, well"
what that smell like, oh, chanel? way too deep like depths in hell
need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forgcoming like—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
take it back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
talkin' em—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
no, no, no, no, no, no, no,radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
every little moment i step in, might shift the planets direction
glitch in the system is present
you might wanna check the connection
i don't give a fuck about freshmans
i don't give a fuck about veterans
if your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
it's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
paradiddles hidden in riddles vapid and accessories
so please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
we claim this spot from the basement, so tell me who you again
oh you was this, you was that?
but now you washed and you hate it?
you taking shots with revolvers, i got two drones at the station
hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
you paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with awe get money, get dough
dame más mi princesa says so (uh)
even though my teeth not gold
baby girl know our pockets drip folds
(woo! woo! woo! woo!)
we get money, get dough

big old whiskey on them icy rocks
flood down some veins like oxy does
i need fresh air, i need oxygen
who the hell you fooling? it's so obvious
i don't feel it, i don't see it, this is blasphemy
i can't help but feel like you is after me
is you drinking for the pain? is you drinking for fun?
there's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
is you dancing all alone? is you dancing for someone?
there's a party outside, know the night is young
is you having fun?

say it with your chest, say it with your chest
pray it work again
putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
say it with your chest, say it with your chest
pray it work again
putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah

but you know if i waste my time
talking 'bout what ain't mine
and you know i'll be last in line
just like last, last night

i said, i said "who that? who that? who that? who that?"
lurking in the shadows
tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
they wanna blackball me, but i held my avocados
then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
circle tighter than the castro, they feeding you castrol
you'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
could be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that i ain't fragile
grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

but you know if i waste my time
talking 'bout what ain't mine
and you know i'll be last in line
just like last, last night

[verse 3: joba]
suicidal thoughts, but i won't do it
take that how you want, it's important i admit it
i'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
when the push comes to shove, i'd rather bend than break
but something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
when you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
or should've made, they're not the same, i'm not the same
maybe i'm broken, either way i'm clinging on closely
i know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
i know that i'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
i know that i'm changing, i know that i'm changing

i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more
i want more out of life than this
i want more, i want more

and mother, i am sorry, i never pick up, mm-hmm
because i'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no

hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to
hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to

we were sat outside on the harvard floor
with our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
i be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
and i see the names circling our thoughts
and i think about if we lose it all
and i turn to shit that you'd never want
like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
and i'll say again, "sorry i don't call"
there's no money on my mind
but my money or my mind
what's the first to fall?
i never wanted this shit, yeah

hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to
hey, and i've been feelin' like i don't matter how i used to

sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
i've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
i feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
i said, "i'll try vacation, i'll try to run away"
i deleted facebook, i'll trade fame any day
for a quiet texas place and a barbecue plate
i'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
my ghost still haunt ya, my life is i, tonya
a big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
i hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
until them headlines came, then first flight i'm stuck in

and maybe it means nothing
but i have to say i think about you often
and if you want no part with me
i'll walk away, i know that i have wronged you
and maybe it means nothing
but i have to say i think about you often
and if you want no part with me
i'll walk away, i know that i have wronged you

i took a plane to somewhere that i've never been
too many times without my sister and my brother
dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
i always hear it, i know they feel it
my momma always had these dreams that used to keep her up at night
i smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
i'm void of feelin'
the reasons i'm so out of touch now start revealin'
but i'm not ashamed, i'm not afraid of who i am
or how i trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
but i guess that's just the shit i'm into
i fantasize about a time when everything was simple
my shelter sheltered me from things i needed to commit to
the way it stands to me
a victim of stockholm in my friendships and family

what's costin' your time? what's the reason that you whine?
what's in your wallet? dead whites in mine
so sour, in this light of lime
daddy said "study or get that cash"
mommy said "your career ain't gon' last"
loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
i just need a chance to move past my past
don't think too fast, private jets still crash
and i'll still fly coach, and i'll still hit a roach
and i'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and i'm gonna tell it!)

i will
i will
(i don't matter)
i will
(ahh)
can i tell you how?
can i tell you now?
i will

"take it all or leave it"

i can't sleep like i used to
the world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
explain yourself, your thoughts
your motives and all of your reasons
two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
in the evenings when i see ’em
i tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
need something new to believe in
'cause these new niggas'll change on you
i mean they change on you
why the hell the bbc only writes about me
when it comes down to controversy?
what about three cd's in one year with no label?
then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
i was that nigga in a room
with no motherfuckin' cable and no table
now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
you don't understand why i do what i do, so let me do it
get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it

i don't speak like i used to
i’m thinking of a way to change the world that i move through
i feel like nikola, what i invent is what i’m true to
i feel for nikola with these ideas that i grew through
i know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
it’s hard to feel what's real, some nights i'm scared that i'm delusional
i’m scared i'm more like nikola than i'd ever collude to
i'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'cause there isn't room for peace i can achieve

you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
i keep tellin' ya
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout

stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
stay rough, get buff, get out
the monsters swarm 'round with them toys
the monsters swarm 'round with them toys
hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
the monsters swarm 'round with them toys
the monsters swarm 'round with them toys

don't mind me, i'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
but if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
don't mind me, i'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
but if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
i don't know these people, i don't know you either, no more
i'm at war with myself
every time i see this shit i wanna kill myself
and they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
think they fallin' in love but i'd rather be dead
please just leave me alone, i don't wanna be read
yeah, yeah

you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
i keep tellin' ya
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
i keep tellin' ya
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
i keep tellin' ya
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout
i keep tellin' ya
you don't understand why i can't get up and shout

it's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
you are now about to experience
these are the best years of our lives
i feel you
