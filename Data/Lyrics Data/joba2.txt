Good riddance, goodbye, out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time, this time I get what's mine
Where the hell is your back bone?
Ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice, make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama, but I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile
Pressure
Pressure
Pressure
Pressure
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Take it all or leave it
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—

Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Take it all or leave it
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking by my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sipping on my (Sipping on my), smoking on my (Smoking by my)
Ingesting my (ingesting my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
It's getting hot, you best just—
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
The effects can't touch this
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Stand up, stand down, bitch
Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down
Wait, wait, wait
Praise God, hallelujah! (God, God) I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience, paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah! (God, God) I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience, paranoid, I can't—

Flicking on the face of my wrist watch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lyin', don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with
Tragedy after tragedy, God, send a message
Send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank

'Til the casket drops, I will play God
Fuck the world, let's start a riot
Got too much, too quick
God damn, I'm feelin' sick, bitch, call the doctor
Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view, on that petty shit
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of the fuck shit need to get away
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people
I thought I knew better, wish I knew better
Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers
Guess I'm too real
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank, suitcase
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, bank, bank

Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing

And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it


Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here
oh, ooh, beautiful and bashful
Ooh (Mmm), ooh, ooh (Mmm)
I'm beautiful and bashful
Boy, bye
Goddamn (Sheesh)
Boy, bye

Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right)
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'

Who the Hell am I?
Who the Hell are you?
Don't waste my time, I got shit to do
Been in love with you, don't know what to do
Still searchin' for the truth, every which way
Mental foreplay, bound by cuffs to you
Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better (Make me better)


Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced (Uh-huh), insane

Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you ho bitch
Witness sadistic shit, will come again
Next time I take my belt off, spank you
Bad kid, bad seed, not me, got beef
I leave body, blackout from rage
Childproof my pockets, don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly
