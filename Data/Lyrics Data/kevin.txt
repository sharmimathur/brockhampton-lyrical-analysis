Can't drive, so I'm still running

But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight, I get seasick
Did ya see all the art that we did?
Did all that shit in a weekend
We was up all late tweakin', yeah
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday

Rollin' in my truck (Uh-huh), gotta keep it tucked (Uh-huh)
Cause whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag (Uh-huh), neighbors call me "fag" (Uh-huh)
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag

There go that danger boy, danger boy!

Oh-hoooo!

I gotta get better at being me (Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar

Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me

Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
"Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair."
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not

I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...

I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag

I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough

I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away


Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend


feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
Uh, I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down (my nigga)
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)
(Ride slow, ride slow, slow)
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my
Head, head, head, head, head, head, head, head (woo, slow)

Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola–


They throw me in the crowd and tell me "Boy, I'd lose that smile"
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had
