No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (Hoo!)
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I can enjoy
At night I bring them out, I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it under my wheel (There's not a soul in here—)
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back (There's not a soul in here—)
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big ass house and big ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut really know the place
But you don't know me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)
I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, "You lucky where you at"
"You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that"
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering "who is me?" now
Wondering "where you been?" now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14
I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now
Make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now
When there's a rough patch, don't eye for the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
This a treat ain't it, soon as she hit the powder room
I pull it back and check my rose, and yeah, I'm 'bout to bloom
It's that '90 raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lane switch
Combat how you feel, strobe light, I hit the killswitch
Neck twist like Exorcist, I'ma see you 'round
'Cause tonight's the night I'm losin' all I'm doin', I'm about this
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Just give me what I need)
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
All my jewelry, and all my niggas (Yes)
All my jewelry, and all my niggas got that, yeah (Yes, yes)
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
¿Cómo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell, numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like "Oh, well"
What that smell like, oh, Chanel? Way too deep like depths in hell
Need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forget me

Coming like—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Take it back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' em—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' 'bout—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' em—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you fooling? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?
I will
I will
I will
I will
I will
I will
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you

Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

I'm sure I'll find it
I'm sure I'll find it

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

Man, this shit bump like a belly when it's pregnant (Mhm)
Bonafide big brr lookin' like a Yeti (Mhm)
Swift feet cheetah, that's a real big kitty
Who made y'all judges? That's a real ass feeling
I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em (Yeah)
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend (Alright)
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun
But I make your bitch crack a giggle with the next one (Oh)
Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin (Sheesh)
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin' (Shit)
Actin' like Regina, you a lil' bit dramatic (George)
I been in the cockpit, I been in the cabin (Right)
Take the ego out, just revolve around the planet (Right)
Damn, I'm like Kirby, man, I don't take damage
Oh, so hot, so, sst, get branded
I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it

My bitch, she so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Mmh)
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)

S-s-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
They ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more
S-s-s-s-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
They-they-they ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more

Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more
I don't need to clutch no more
Some things outside of my control
I need some space, I need to grow
So I go, plague my soul
Say I won't
I never tried to let you go so deep, deep, deep, deep

How you do that right there, boo, I'm bamboozled, yeah
Legs go up behind the head like leopard ambushin', huh
Give her space, big ol' drop, call it Grand Canyon, huh
She bust back, blow a fuse out the damn cannon
Circus, olé, okay (Yeah), roly (Woah)
Poly, slide that (Uh), pole, yeah, (Hm) low blow (Ooh)
Not seen like a dodo (No), I skip fall, stay snow globe (Ayy)
Stuck inside the corridor (Ayy), make me go so loco (Ayy)
Major League, I'm Sheen (Uh), call me Wild Thing (Uh)
She got strings all up the neck just like a violin (Ah)
I crave that chada-ching, when that venom sting (Hey)
Eyes turn redder than a motherfuckin' cherry stem

Watch your back, (Ayy) don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back, (What?) don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all
